<body id="about">
    
    <p> This site was made in summer 2019.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I used gifs from gifcities.org, a website that archives gifs from old geocities cites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All of the tarot "cards" are made using gifs that represent the tarot card!!! They are all based on the rider waite tarot deck (although <em>I</em> think it should be called the Colman-Smith deck because she actually did all the art >:-(!! But ppl usually call it the Rider-Waite deck)</p>
    <br>
    <p>The backgound color of each card is color coded according to its kabbalistic symbolism!!!! The whole page only uses basic html colors that have a name in html like "violet" or "darkorange".</p>
    <br>
    <p>Right now this website just uses the Major Arcana cards, but one day it will include all 72 cards in the deck!!!!!!!!</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can just pull one card at a time. So before you hit shuffle, decide how many cards you need to answer your question!! You can find out more about tarot cards <a href src="abouttarot.html">here</a></p>

    <br>
    <p>When you're ready to hit shuffle, think hard about your question, close your eyes, and swirl your mouse around, then open your eyes and click the shuffle button!!</p>
